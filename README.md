## Introduction
This project applies linear algebra to predict product prices using data extracted from e-commerce sites. Participants will
gather and transform data, then train and evaluate a linear regression model. Through hands-on experience, they will
enhance their understanding of data analysis and regression techniques in real-world applications.

Our project contains these steps:
- 1.1 Data Collection
- 1.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation
- 2.1 Linear Regression Model
- 3.1 Price Prediction

## Mobile Price Prediction
Building an application using the tkinter library.

## Conclusion

According to the final results, we can conclude that one reason the model did not perform well is that the linear regression model is not suitable for this dataset, and other models should be considered. Additionally, while we are not certain, there is also a possibility that the site from which we extracted the data was not suitable for our project.
